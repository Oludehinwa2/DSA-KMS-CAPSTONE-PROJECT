## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Project Title:
KMS Mega Stores Performance & Customer Insights (2009‚Äì2012)
Tools Used: SQL Server, Excel (for result presentation & dashboard)

## üìò Overview
This project analyzes four years of transactional data for KMS Mega Stores to uncover insights into product performance, customer behavior, shipping efficiency, and regional sales patterns. It forms part of a Business Intelligence Capstone using SQL for deep querying and business reasoning.

As a Junior Data Analyst, I conducted extensive SQL-based analysis across two tables:

	‚Ä¢	kms_orders: Primary dataset containing sales, product, region, shipping, and customer details
 
	‚Ä¢	order_status: Secondary table tracking return statuses
 
## üéØ Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate sales and profit performance across categories and regions
 
	‚Ä¢	Identify high- and low-performing customers and products
 
	‚Ä¢	Uncover shipping patterns and operational costs
 
	‚Ä¢	Analyze returns and customer segments
 
	‚Ä¢	Recommend strategies for increasing revenue and customer satisfaction
 
üìå Key Business Questions Answered (with SQL)

### Case Scenario I ‚Äì Business Performance

	1.	Highest-selling product category
 
	2.	Top 3 and bottom 3 regions by sales
 
	3.	Appliance sales in Ontario
 
	4.	Recommendations for increasing revenue from bottom 10 customers
 
	5.	Shipping method with the highest cost
 
### Case Scenario II ‚Äì Customer Insights

	6.	Top 5 valuable customers and what they typically buy
 
	7.	Best-performing Small Business customer
 
	8.	Most frequent Corporate customer (2009‚Äì2012)
 
	9.	Most profitable Consumer customer
 
	10.	Which customers returned products and their segment
 
	11.	Shipping cost estimation & average shipping days
 
	12.	Priority vs Shipping Mode efficiency
 
## üõ† SQL Techniques Used

	‚Ä¢	GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, DISTINCT, WHERE, OFFSET-FETCH
 
	‚Ä¢	DATEDIFF() for shipping days
 
	‚Ä¢	SUM(), AVG(), ROUND() for aggregations
 
	‚Ä¢	Subqueries and filtered joins for customer behavior and returns
 
	‚Ä¢	Data cleanup using LTRIM(), RTRIM() for status fields

## üßæ Conclusion

The KMS SQL case study provided a comprehensive view of the business‚Äôs performance between 2009 and 2012. By leveraging structured query techniques, we extracted actionable insights across multiple dimensions ‚Äî including customer behavior, sales trends, product profitability, and shipping efficiency.

Through this analysis, it became clear that regional focus, customer segmentation, and shipping strategy are critical levers for improving overall business performance. We also identified key customer groups, high-return segments, and opportunities to optimize costs, especially around logistics.

This project not only demonstrates my ability to apply SQL in a real-world business context, but also shows how data can guide strategic decisions for e-commerce or retail platforms. Going forward, these insights could serve as a strong foundation for advanced dashboarding (Power BI, Excel), reporting automation, or further customer lifetime value (CLV) and return rate analysis
